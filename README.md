# Job Offers REST API

A Simple API for job offers built with Flask restplus Framework and Postgres database.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

In order to run the project in a local environment, all you need is Docker and docker-compose tool installed.
You may also want to have `pipenv` tool installed to run the project in a virtual environment

### Building the project

Go to the project directory where `docker-compose.yaml` and `Dockerfile` are located and run the command:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

### Running the project with Docker

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d postgres
$ docker-compose up
```

> **Note**: When running the project for the first time, make sure to run the `postgres` container first then run the `api` container. running `docker-compose up` will cause the application to crash since the database is not ready to accept connetions.

### Running the project with a virtual environment

After activating the `virtualenv`:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ./script/runserver.sh
```

The script will run the database instance with docker and start the server.


### Running the tests

Tests use a real database to make the testing environment similar to production, also note that some database features such as `string array` are not available for sqlite.

To run tests use the script:

```bash
$ ./script/test.sh
```

### API Swagger

All API endpoints can be requested from the swagger UI

> **Tip**: Use Authorize button to load your JWT after login.

## CI/CD pipeline

Gitlab CI/CD pipeline is responsible for running jobs after each code push, it includes the following stages:

- Build: Build the application docker image.
- Test: Run integration tests agianst the built image to check the code validity.
- Staging: Deploy the application to staging environment for further testing.
- Production: Deploy the application to production environment

## Deployment

The deployment is done automatically to staging environment after pushing the code, you can check the deploy stage in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to see how the deployment is performed.

The `helm` tool was used to deploy to kubernetes, Helm supports many features such as rolling upgrades and rollbacks with all the changes being version controlled.

The deployments environments for the pipeline are:
- staging: https://job-offers-api-staging.apps.abdelhalimresu.com/
- production: https://job-offers-api.apps.abdelhalimresu.com/

Traefik was used as ingress class for kubernetes to allow access to application within the cluster.

## Monitoring

### System resources usage monitoring

To monitor the resources usage within the cluser, Prometheus and Grafana were used.

- Credentials: admin:abdelhalim 

Monitoring is done on many levels:

- Node level
- Deployment level
- Pod level

### Error tracking

Sentry was used for errors reporting and tracking.
